      <h3>Football</h3>
      <p>Football (soccer) is a popular team sport played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. Two teams of 11 players compete to score goals by getting the ball into the opponent’s net, primarily using their feet but also their heads and torsos—except for the goalkeepers, who can use their hands within the penalty area. Matches consist of two 45-minute halves, and the team with the most goals at the end wins. Football emphasizes teamwork, strategy, and skill, and major tournaments like the FIFA World Cup bring together fans and teams from around the world.

      <h3>Cricket</h3>
      <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of eleven players on a field. The game consists of "innings" where one team bats, trying to score as many runs as possible, while the other team bowls and fields to restrict runs and dismiss the batters. Runs are scored by hitting the ball and running between the wickets or by hitting boundaries. A batter can be dismissed in various ways, such as being bowled, caught, or run out. Cricket formats vary from Test matches (up to 5 days) to limited-overs formats like One Day Internationals (50 overs) and T20s (20 overs), each with unique strategies and pacing.

      <h3>Rugby</h3>
      <p> Rugby is a contact sport played between two teams of 15 players (in rugby union) or 13 players (in rugby league) on a rectangular field. Players aim to carry, pass, or kick an oval ball to score points by grounding it in the opponent's in-goal area (a "try") or kicking it through the goalposts. Unlike in American football, players don’t wear extensive protective gear, and passes must be lateral or backward. Rugby is known for its physicality, strategic plays, and continuous flow, with famous tournaments like the Rugby World Cup attracting global attention.

      <p>Two-Line Pass (Historical Rule): In the past, the NHL had a "two-line pass rule," which restricted players from passing the puck across two blue lines (including the center red line). This rule aimed to limit fast, long passes and maintain closer play. However, the league eliminated this rule in 2005 to encourage a faster, more open game with fewer stoppages.</p>

      <p>Batting or Fielding Drills: Coaches often organize players into two lines during drills. For example, in hitting or fielding practice, one line might work on batting while the other practices fielding, or two lines of players might alternate fielding grounders or fly balls.

      <h3>tennis</h3>
      <p>Tennis is a racquet sport played on a rectangular court, where players hit a small, felt-covered rubber ball over a net and aim to score points by landing the ball in their opponent's court without it being returned. Matches are played in singles (one-on-one) or doubles (two-on-two) formats. Players win points by hitting shots that the opponent can't return or by forcing errors. A game consists of points, a set consists of games, and matches are won by taking the best of three or five sets. Tennis combines strategy, precision, and agility, with popular tournaments like Wimbledon and the US Open attracting global audiences.
